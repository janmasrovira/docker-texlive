* Readme
  Custom image of the texlive distribution. 

  It contains most of the packages (~3k/4k) but only supports English and has no
  extra fonts.

  Note that I used the installation script to create all (2020, 2021) images.
  This script, always installs the latest version of texlive, thus, results may
  not be reproducible.
